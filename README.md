# shocm zsh themes

There are actually 2 zsh themes in this repo. The primary one being `shocm.zsh-theme` which is heavily influenced (and forked from) my friend [TJ Miller's](https://github.com/sixlive) repo https://github.com/sixlive/sixlive-zsh-theme. It is meant to be a clean interface.

The second theme is `shocm2.zsh-theme`. I am sure that theme was also influced by another theme but it's been so long I honestly can't remember where I started that theme from.
